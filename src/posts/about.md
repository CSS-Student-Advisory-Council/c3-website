## âŒ› History of CÂ³
 We are the Computing Careers Club here at the University of Washington Bothell. 
 
 Other names include: 
 - CS Careers Club 
 - CÂ³ (Pronounced: "C cubed") or C3 


Our roots began as the SAC (Student Advisory Council) back in Spring 2022. As the SAC had an increasingly complex scope and need for engagement, Computing Careers Club was formed to inherit the resources and events of SAC, so that more students are able to participate and get involved in our projects. 

## âœ¨ What does CÂ³ do? 
 CÂ³ intends to be a project-driven club focused on career development, where student members have the opportunity to contribute to our open-source career guides, help with event hosting, and pitch their own project ideas to the team. Within this community, you can find collaborators, team members, and make friends on shared interests and goals.

##  âŒ› History of the CSS SAC

 The SAC is a student-led organization that focuses on curricular development and student feedback, and hosted resources and events for students until CÂ³ was created to inherit public-facing projects. 

 
 ### ðŸ’¡ The beginnings - CSS 449 

  
In Spring 2021, SAC was formed by students to ease the tribulations of providing, advocating, and having meaningful involvement with CSS curriculum development. 

 As an early example of our advocacy, one of our founding members, and a former ACM president advocated for an algorithms course to be offered as an elective for students, through 1:1 meetings and emails with professors. With its success, CSS 449 (Analysis & Design of Algorithms) was offered the following Spring 2022. 


 ###  ðŸš€ Where we are now
 As of Summer 2022, the SAC grew with more members, and has established connections with faculty/commitees in CSS involved with curricular improvement and industry connections. Over the past year, we have been able to explore many avenues for feedback and learned more about the CSS program's history and future projects. We aim to take a hands-on and mindful role working with CSS faculty, making sure our student representatives are able to communicate clearly, defend and be reliable collaborators.
